# [Artificial Neural Network Project](https://ann-project-d2pqezobe2gj3yvwaqctsx.streamlit.app)

### Description
- This repository contains a project focused on developing and training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The project involves:
- Data preprocessing (e.g., handling categorical features using One-Hot Encoding).
- Building, training, and evaluating the ANN model.
- Performing predictions and analyzing results.

### The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment using Python.

### Project Overview

- The notebook processes the input dataset, combines encoded features with the original data, and trains an ANN model. The key steps include:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation.

- Feature Encoding and Transformation.

- ANN Model Development.

- Model Training and Evaluation.

### Technologies Used

- The following Python libraries and tools are required to run this project:

- Python 3.12.2

- Jupyter Notebook

- TensorFlow/Keras - for building and training the ANN model.

- Pandas - for data manipulation and preprocessing.

- NumPy - for numerical computations.

- Scikit-learn - for preprocessing and model evaluation.

- Matplotlib/Seaborn - for data visualization.

### Setup and Installation

- Clone the Repository:

```python
git clone https://github.com/Saimoguloju/ANN-Project.git
cd your-repository-name
```

- Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

```python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

- Install Dependencies:
- Install the required libraries using pip:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Run the Project

- Launch Jupyter Notebook:

- jupyter notebook

- Open the notebook file ANN_Project.ipynb.

- Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.

### Results and Performance

- After training the ANN, the model's performance (accuracy, loss, etc.) will be displayed.

- Visualizations of training history and predictions will be provided in the notebook.
